## What is this? <!-- omit in toc -->

- Olshansky's day-to-day agent skills
- Follows the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/home) pattern for cross-tool skill distribution
- Inspired by [vercel-labs/agent-skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-skills)

## Quickstart

```bash
npx skills add olshansk/agent-skills
```

Then ask your agent to run any installed skill:

- _"resolve merge conflicts"_
- _"close the loop on this session"_
- _"idiot proof the documentation"_
- _"generate skills dashboard"_

> [!TIP]
> Start with [`cmd-session-commit`](skills/cmd-session-commit/SKILL.md) — it turns every coding session into durable knowledge by extracting patterns, decisions, and gotchas into your `AGENTS.md`. Future sessions (and future agents) pick up right where you left off.

### 3rd Party Skills

Install skills from other publishers with `npx skills add <publisher>/<repo>`.

- [garrytan/gstack](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack/) — browser automation, QA, plan review, deploy workflows, and more
- [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) — React and TypeScript patterns
- [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) — miscellaneous productivity skills

## Star History

[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=olshansk/agent-skills&type=date&legend=top-left)](https://www.star-history.com/#olshansk/agent-skills&type=date&legend=top-left)

## Demo of `cmd-skills-dashboard`

A live dashboard of the skills.sh ecosystem is available at **[skills-dashboard.olshansky.info](https://skills-dashboard.olshansky.info/)**.

It shows publisher distribution, install counts, top skills, and the long-tail power law of adoption. Regenerate it yourself with the `cmd-skills-dashboard` skill.

## How It Works

### Symlink Architecture <!-- omit in toc -->

Two sources of truth feed into every tool's skills directory:

```mermaid
graph TB
    classDef workspace fill:#d4e6f1,stroke:#2980b9,stroke-width:2px,color:#000
    classDef dotdir fill:#fadbd8,stroke:#e74c3c,stroke-width:2px,color:#000

    subgraph sources["Source of Truth"]
        thirdparty["~/.agents/skills/*<br/>(third-party skills)"]
        repo["~/workspace/agent-skills/<br/>·  skills/*  ·  agents/*  ·<br/>(your skills)"]
    end

    subgraph claude["~/.claude/"]
        direction LR
        claude_skills["skills/*"]
        claude_md["CLAUDE.md"]
    end

    subgraph gemini["~/.gemini/"]
        direction LR
        gemini_skills["antigravity/skills/*"]
        gemini_md["GEMINI.md"]
    end

    subgraph codex["~/.codex/"]
        direction LR
        codex_skills["skills/*"]
        codex_md["AGENTS.md"]
    end

    repo -->|"symlink (wins on conflict)"| claude_skills
    repo -->|"symlink (wins on conflict)"| gemini_skills
    repo -->|"symlink (wins on conflict)"| codex_skills
    repo -->|"AGENTS.md"| claude_md
    repo -->|"AGENTS.md"| codex_md
    repo -->|"MEMORIES.md"| gemini_md

    thirdparty -->|"symlink"| claude_skills
    thirdparty -->|"symlink"| gemini_skills
    thirdparty -->|"symlink"| codex_skills

    class repo workspace
    class thirdparty,claude_skills,claude_md,gemini_skills,gemini_md,codex_skills,codex_md dotdir
```

| Skill type      | Source of truth       | Installed via      | Symlink target                      |
| --------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **Your skills** | `skills/` (this repo) | `make link-skills` | `~/workspace/agent-skills/skills/*` |
| **Third-party** | `~/.agents/skills/`   | `npx skills add`   | `~/.agents/skills/*`                |

### Makefile Workflows <!-- omit in toc -->

```mermaid
graph LR
    classDef default color:#000

    skills["agent-skills/skills/*"]
    agents["agent-skills/agents/"]

    subgraph outbound["Symlink OUT"]
        link["make link-skills"]
    end

    subgraph inbound["Copy IN"]
        sync["make sync"]
    end

    claude_dir["~/.claude/"]
    gemini_dir["~/.gemini/"]
    codex_dir["~/.codex/"]
    snapshots["~/workspace/configs/"]

    skills -->|"skills symlink"| link
    agents -->|"instructions symlink"| link
    link --> claude_dir
    link --> gemini_dir
    link --> codex_dir

    claude_dir -->|"file copy"| sync --> snapshots
    gemini_dir -->|"file copy"| sync
    codex_dir -->|"file copy"| sync
```

| Target             | Description                                                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `make link-skills` | Symlink repo + third-party skills into Claude, Gemini, and Codex |
| `make list-skills` | List all skills with descriptions                                |
| `make config-review` | Review workstation configuration drift without changing files |
| `make config-secrets-check` | Scan tracked workstation configuration for literal secrets |
| `make config-backup` | Back up managed workstation configuration                    |
| `make config-snapshot` | Snapshot selected live configuration outside the repository |
| `make config-setup` | Back up and install canonical workstation configuration       |
| `make setup`       | Set up workstation configuration and agent skill links          |
| `make test`        | Validate skill frontmatter and repo consistency                  |

Workstation configuration is canonical in `~/workspace/configs`.

The `config-*` targets delegate to that repository through `CONFIGS_DIR`; `make setup` runs configuration setup before restoring skill and instruction symlinks.

### After `npx skills add` <!-- omit in toc -->

`npx skills add` installs skills into `~/.agents/skills/` and creates symlinks in `~/.claude/skills/`. Running `make link-skills` afterward restores your repo skills (which take precedence on name conflicts), removes stale entries previously installed from this repository, and extends third-party skills to Codex and Gemini.
