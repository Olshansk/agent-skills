## What is this? <!-- omit in toc -->

- Olshansky's day-to-day agent skills
- Follows the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/home) pattern for cross-tool skill distribution
- Inspired by [vercel-labs/agent-skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-skills)

## Quickstart

```bash
npx skills add olshansk/agent-skills
```

Then ask your agent to run any installed skill:

- _"resolve merge conflicts"_
- _"close the loop on this session"_
- _"idiot proof the documentation"_
- _"generate skills dashboard"_

> [!TIP]
> Start with [`session-commit`](skills/session-commit/SKILL.md) — it turns every coding session into durable knowledge by extracting patterns, decisions, and gotchas into your `AGENTS.md`. Future sessions (and future agents) pick up right where you left off.

## Available Skills

### Polished Skills

Skills I've polished for public use.

| [`session-commit`](skills/session-commit/SKILL.md)     | Captures session learnings and updates `AGENTS.md` safely     | "run session commit", "close the loop", "update AGENTS.md" |
| [`skills-dashboard`](skills/skills-dashboard/SKILL.md) | Scrapes skills.sh and generates an interactive HTML dashboard | "generate skills dashboard", "show skills ecosystem"       |

### Personal Skills (`cmd-*`)

Skills I use daily but might rename or delete in the future. I prefix them with `cmd-` so I can easily also leverage them as custom slash commands in claude code.

## Demo of `skills-dashboard`

A live dashboard of the skills.sh ecosystem is available at **[skills-dashboard.olshansky.info](https://skills-dashboard.olshansky.info/)**.

It shows publisher distribution, install counts, top skills, and the long-tail power law of adoption. Regenerate it yourself with the `skills-dashboard` skill.
